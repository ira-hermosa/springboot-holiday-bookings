# Holiday bookings app

Holiday Bookings is an application to create online holiday bookings. This app was developed to consolidate my learnings of Spring Boot, Mockito and JUnit5 testing.

The app allows user to:
- add a booking
- add multiple bookings
- read all bookings
- read bookings by their IDs
- update bookings
- delete booking by id
- delete all bookings
- search booking by the object properties, e.g. price range, weather, country name etc.

# Technologies
- The application was built using Java, SpringBoot, Maven, MySQL and H2 instance and runs locally on port 8081
- Service and Controller methods have been tested using JUnit5 and Mockito. Overall testing coverage is currently at 92.2%
- API endpoints can be tested with Postman
